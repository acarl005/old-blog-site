      Ever wonder how stuff is positioned on a webpage? <del>So do I.</del> It's done with padding, borders, and margins. Imagine the webpage as a party of knights, where each knight is a picture, paragraph, or piece of web content! Each knight has a suit of armor, like the borders on a website. These help make things look nice and organized. But inside these borders is padding, space separating the borders from the content. This is like the clothes beneath the knight's armor! Finally, imagine they have a forcefield around them that keeps walls and other knights at a distance. These are the margins. The margins are the outermost separation. Together, these map out a webpage to make it look polished and pretty!
