    <h6>A prop. 65 warning at Starbuck's</h6>
    <p>
      Proposition 65 was originally passed in 1986, but the public is becoming abundantly aware of it recently. Why? <em>Because signs are popping up warning Californians about cancer-causing chemicals in restaurants!</em> Should we be in hysterics? Not exactly...
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the requirements of this proposition is that businesses must post warnings if there are detectable levels of known harmful chemicals in their product or premises. As it turns out, these chemicals are (some of) the culprits: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylamide">acrylamide</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzopyrene">benzopyrene</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterocyclic_amine_formation_in_meat">HCAs</a>. These actually occur naturally, including in your own kitchen. Acrylamide is formed from heating starch-rich foods, such as potatoes, bread, and cookies. Benzopyrene and HCAs are formed from burning protein-rich foods, particularly meat. Actually, benzopyrene can form from burning many carbon sources, like charcoal and gasoline. These signs are there beause of chemicals that arise <u>simply from heating food</u>, not because of any pernicious additives.

      Foods are amalgams of countless chemical entities, and by cooking them you cause them to react and form a myriad of new compounds. We do this because these new compounds enhance the flavor of the food, but we're inadvertently forming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogen">carcinogens</a> as well. So should you avoid restaurants with these warnings? Probably not. It's likely that you've been consuming these chemicals on a regular basis. They're there when you toast bread or put flawless grill marks on your chicken breast. Although they are <em>detectable</em> in cooked foods, <strong>it's not likely that the amounts are sufficient to exert carcinogenic effects.</strong>
