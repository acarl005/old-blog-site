      <h2>Pairing and Feedback</h2>
      <h3>Cornerstones of Growth at DBC</h3>
      <h4><em>Mar 2, 2015</em></h4>

      <p>
        <strong>Pairing is caring!</strong> I've seen this phrase in DBC documents since before phase 0 even began. Pair programming is one of the program's most emphasized and acclaimed requirements for its guidance and enjoyment. <em>But what is pair programming?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two types of pair programming at DBC: guided and peer pairing. Peer pairing is arranged by two students independently. They attempt a programming challenge wherein they assume the role of driver and navigator. The navigator makes the big-picture decisions, like how the objectives will be met, what the strategies are, and what data structures and methods will be used. The driver is the one at the terminal. He/she works out the fine details and syntactical decisions. DBC requires two of these sessions per week. A guided pairing session (GPS) is a DBC-scheduled challenge supervised by an experienced guide, usually an alumnus/alumna. In most other respects, the structure is the same. Two students (a driver and a navigator) work together under the oversight of this guide to solve a problem. The purpose of the guide is to provide assistance, if needed, and observe the progress of the students. These are required twice every three weeks.

      <p>
        Pairing is so effective because the solutions that a pair of programmers produce is a synthesis of both of their skills and experience. The synergistic effect mutually enriches and educates. I've learned so much from my colleagues by pairing! New methods, new strategies, and new perspectives are illuminated by my cohort mates. GPS are also very helpful because you acquire the wisdom of an experienced programmer. This can eliminate some of the time and torment involved when encountering bugs. At times we all need a bit of informed leadership to ensure we adhere to the proper coding conventions. <em>No matter how advanced you are, pairing is invaluable.</em> It teaches you to open your mind, builds teamwork and communication skills, and accelerates you growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a <a href="c3-thinking-style.html">previous post</a>, I mentioned DBC's foundation upon the <strong>growth mindset</strong>. This involves being receptive to criticism and striving to redress it. Because pairing is an opportunity to encounter your obstacles, giving and receiving feedback for each pairing session is also required. Don't worry, the feedback is anonymous and always <strong>kind</strong>. But it's also <strong>specific and actionable</strong>, so the recipient can use it to improve. The feedback I've received has made me confident in reaching out to my cohort mates. Every time I do so I know I'm bonding with my colleagues and becoming a more evolved, refined programmer.
