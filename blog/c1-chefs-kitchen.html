      One factor that influenced my choice in DBC instead of other bootcamps is that it's been around longer. I figured it to be a "tried and true" program. However, <a href="http://vimeo.com/85001014">Shereef</a> made it clear that this isn't true. DBC improves constantly! It changes and adapts with each new cohort. Each person who walks through the door is part of this grand experiment. As a scientist, I think this is fantastic! It's our effort and ingenuity that will make this program work for us. I love this philosophy and I'm determined to hone my skills until I have what it takes to succeed! However, I do have some trepidations. I know the "dream job" is not guarenteed. Although DBC has a constantly changing curriculum, it's naive to assume every change is <em>good</em>.
