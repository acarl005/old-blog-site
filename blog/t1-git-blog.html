      Scientists often have an organized list of their publications available on their website with hyperlinks so that interested parties can easily view all their work. Artists have comprehensive collections of their work in portfolios for a similar purpose. For many programmers, the analogy is Github! Github is a website that shares your code with colleagues and potential employers. It has even greater utility insofar as it also improves workflow using complementary software called Git. Git is "version control" software, meaning it keeps track of previous iterations of a project. In case the development of your code inadvertently breaks some part of the program, you can return to previous saved versions of it. In conjunction with Github, it allows multiple programmers to synthesize their changes to a project into a single file. Therefore they don't need to be in the same room to efficiently contribute to the project! For these reasons, Git and Github are highly favored among modern developers.
